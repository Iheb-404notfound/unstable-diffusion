# Unstable Diffusion

**Author:** Iheb Gafsi

## Overview

Unstable Diffusion is an implementation inspired by Stable Diffusion, a powerful text-to-image AI generator released in 2022. The primary goal of this project is to explore variations and enhancements to the Stable Diffusion model, providing users with a unique and experimental approach to text-based image generation.

## Stable Diffusion

Stable Diffusion, the foundational model for this project, is a deep learning model designed to generate stunning, photorealistic images based on text descriptions. It acts as a creative tool, transforming textual prompts into detailed and lifelike images. Key features of Stable Diffusion include:

- **Text-to-Image:** Generate images based on textual prompts.
- **High-Quality Results:** Produce photorealistic and detailed images.
- **Accessibility:** Open-source and compatible with personal computers, making it accessible to a wider audience.
- **Versatility:** In addition to text-to-image generation, Stable Diffusion can perform inpainting, outpainting, and image-to-image translation.

## Unstable Diffusion

Unstable Diffusion builds upon Stable Diffusion, introducing experimental variations and potential improvements to the existing model. It serves as a playground for creative exploration, allowing users to experiment with novel ideas and contribute to the evolution of text-to-image generation.

## Key Features

- **Latent Diffusion:** Building on Stable Diffusion's stability, Unstable Diffusion explores novel techniques to enhance model performance and reduce processing requirements.
- **Experimental Enhancements:** Users can leverage Unstable Diffusion to experiment with variations and improvements, fostering innovation in text-based image generation.
- **Open-Source Philosophy:** Like Stable Diffusion, Unstable Diffusion embraces an open-source approach, providing transparency and encouraging community involvement.
